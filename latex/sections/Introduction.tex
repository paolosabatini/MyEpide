\section{Introduction}
The document studies and develop the model Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIQRS) described in literature \cite{MingLiu} in a small-world approximation. This model divides the available population into these five categories and make them evolve in time. All the individuals are connected to a subset of the population, regulated via dedicated parameter. The model is described and studied in Section~\ref{sec:model}. In this section the coupled equations for the population evolution are introduced, following the notation in \cite{MingLiu}, and the obtained results are compared with the literature and discussed. The impact on the model predictions of the parameters is checked. The collected data in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy and Italy are reported in Section~\ref{}, and used as benchmark to refine the model and provide a description of the outbreak evolution.
Templates of the total cases distributions in time are extracted for some parameters choice and used to perform a Template fit on the Lombardy dataset. This is shown in Section~\ref{}.
